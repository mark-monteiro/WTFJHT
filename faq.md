The cost of running What The Fuck Just Happened Today isn't free. It's [my full-time job]({{ site.baseurl }}/meta/trump-creates-one-new-job/) and I'm determined to keep this ad-free for as long as possible.

Here's a rough estimate of the monthly costs:

**Hosting:**
The site is hosted on Amazon S3 because it's highly scalable, reliable, fast, and generally an inexpensive data storage infrastructure option. _Monthly Cost:_ ~$20

**Site Search:**
This giant repository of news isn't very valuable if you can't find what you're looking for. I've implemented <a href="https://www.algolia.com/" target="_blank">Algolia</a>, the best instant search option out there. _Monthly Cost:_ $59

**Email Service:**
Oh boy, here's the most expensive part of running this site. I use <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">MailChimp</a> because the ease of use, templating, reporting, and pre-built forms are the best in the business. While there are cheaper options out there, the time-savings is huge. For now, at least...

MailChimp charges by the number of subscribers you have AND the number of monthly emails sent. WTFJHT sends over 2.3M emails/month, and growing.

The costs of sending email will continue to go up as more people subscribe. MailChimp is an awesome company and they've provided us with a 15% discount. _Monthly Cost:_ At least $800

**WTFJHT Community Center:**
While not technically launched, yet, I'm launching a private community forum. It's a [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/){:target="_blank"} community hub, which is amazing, free, and open sourced. It needs to be hosted somewhere, however. The provider of choice is [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com){:target="_blank"}. _Monthly Cost:_ ~$20

**Labor:**
Here's my conservative daily breakdown in time spent:

* 3-5 hours researching and collecting stories
* 1-2 hours curating the daily post
* 1-2 hours setting up the post, cutting images, publishing, testing, fixing typos
* 1 hour distributing to Twitter and Facebook
* 1 hour setting up and sending the newsletter
* 1-4 hour site maintenance, help desk/support, etc

And, since I'm both the writer/editor and web developer running this, let's pretend my salary is the average between the two professions in Seattle. Via Glassdoor: [News Editor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/seattle-news-editor-salary-SRCH_IL.0,7_IM781_KO8,19.htm): $63,718. [Senior Web Developer](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/seattle-senior-web-developer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,7_IM781_KO8,28.htm): $98,464. _Monthly Cost:_ ($63,718 + $98,464) / 2 = $81,091/year. <strong>$6,757</strong>

**TOTAL MONTHLY COST:**

$20 (hosting) + $59 (site search) + $800 (email) $20 (community) + $6,757 (labor) = <strong>$7,636</strong>
