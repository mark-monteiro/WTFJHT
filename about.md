<p class="lead"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">WTF Just Happened Today</a> is today's essential newsletter, blog, and community chronicling the daily shock and awe in national politics. Read in moderation.</p>

<p>The goal is to capture the most important news coming out of the White House in a digestable form inspired by <a href="http://www.theskimm.com/">The Skimm</a>, <a href="http://techmeme.com/">Techmeme</a>, and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/13/13936946/twitter-tweetstorm-thread-timeline-medium">tweetstorms</a>. It's like the <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/">Wirecutter</a> for politics.</p>

I started this project because I was having trouble keeping up with the pace of news coming out of the White House from the Trump administration. It started as an Instapaper and Evernote notebook, which quickly became unwieldy as news events started to blur. So, I started logging the news on a day-by-day basis.

What was suppose to be a personal project – a challenge to log the daily shock and awe of the administration's first 100 days – <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/meta/trump-creates-one-new-job/">has become my full-time job.</a> See? Trump *is* creating jobs.

This is, strictly speaking, the news through my lens and not an act of professional journalism – nothing here is my original reporting. However, it is an act of journalism in and of itself: I'm making news-value decisions, crafting, and curating the content selection. You won't find "fair and balanced" objective coverage. This isn't [a view from nowhere](http://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/).

What you will find, however, is an independent voice, personal accountability, and a consideration for how the editorial choices I make impact others. If you're expecting <a href="https://twitter.com/maggieNYT" target="_blank">Maggie Haberman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/glennthrush" target="_blank">Glenn Thrush</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/Fahrenthold" target="_blank">David Fahrenthold</a>, sorry. It's also worth noting that I go through considerable effort to cite the original source of the news. I also try to make sure each recap is rich with a diversity of sources.
