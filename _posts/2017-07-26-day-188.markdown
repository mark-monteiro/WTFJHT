1/ **Senate Republicans shot down their own repeal-and-replace bill** last night as nine of the 52 Republicans voted against it. The repeal-and-replace bill was a compromise measure meant to appeal to both conservatives and moderate Republicans. Mitch McConnell needed 60 votes to pass the bill. Instead, the vote failed 43-57 just hours after the Senate had narrowly voted to begin debate on a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Today, Senators will consider a straight repeal of Obamacare without providing a replacement, which is also expected to fail.

* **The CBO estimated that the “skinny repeal” would lead to 15 million fewer Americans having health insurance 10 years from now**. The skinny repeal would repeal the individual mandate, the employer mandate, and some taxes on the health care industry, while leaving most of Obamacare in place.

* **Tom Price: do whatever "gets us to 50 votes so that we can move forward on a health-care reform legislation."** The Health and Human Services Secretary urged Senate Republicans to aim for the "lowest common denominator" to keep the Obamacare repeal alive.

2/ **The House approved bipartisan sanctions against Russia while limiting Trump's power to waive them** without a Congressional review. The package, which also includes sanctions against Iran and North Korea, passed 419 to 3. It sets up a veto dilemma for Trump: he can sign or veto the bill, but the Senate, like the House, is expected to pass the legislation by a veto-proof margin.

3/ **Russia threatened to retaliate against the new sanctions, warning of a "painful" response** and saying the sanctions make it impossible to achieve Trump's goal of improved Russian relations. Russia has reportedly prepared “economic and political measures that will be adopted if the Senate and Trump support the bill." ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-26/russia-says-new-u-s-sanctions-killing-chances-for-improved-ties))

4/ **Trump tweets that the US will no longer “accept or allow” transgender people in the military**, saying the military “must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory” and it could not afford to accommodate them. The policy decision reverses the transformation of the military under Obama, whose administration allowed transgender people to openly serve in the military. The Pentagon will defer enlistments by transgender applicants, but it's not clear how Trump intends to implement the ban as transgender people already serve in the military.

* **The Texas Senate approved a bill that restricts bathroom access for transgender people**, endorsing a piece of legislation denounced by civil liberties advocates as discriminatory. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-lgbt-idUSKBN1AB037))

5/ **At a rally in Ohio, Trump claimed he can be "more presidential than any president that's ever held this office"** – except for Lincoln. He said that it's easier to "act presidential than what we are doing here tonight" (give a speech) and that "with few exceptions, no president has done anywhere near what we've done in his first six months. Not even close."

6/ **Rex Tillerson is "just taking a little time off,"** but has no plans to resign as Secretary of State. After Trump's public attack on Jeff Sessions, rumors swirled that [Tillerson could resign](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/24/day-186/#7-after-trumps-rebuke-of-sessions-re) from his role citing Trump's behavior as unprofessional. ([USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/07/25/rex-tillerson-taking-little-time-off/510355001/))

7/ **North Korea threatened a nuclear strike on "the heart of the US" if it attempts to remove Kim Jong Un as Supreme Leader**. Meanwhile, US intelligence agencies believe North Korea will be capable of delivering a missile that can reach the continental US in a year. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/25/politics/north-korea-threatens-nuclear-strike-us/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/us/politics/north-korea-missiles.html))

poll/ **49% of Trump voters believe Trump won the popular vote**. Kris Kobach — the vice chair of Trump’s election commission — floated the idea that "we may never know" whether Clinton won the popular vote. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/26/trump-clinton-popular-vote-240966))
