1/ **"I did not collude," Jared Kushner said in prepared remarks ahead of his closed door meeting with the Senate Intelligence Committee today**. Kushner said he was unaware that the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with the Russian lawyer was about providing the Trump campaign with damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Kushner will not be under oath for the Senate meeting. He will speak to the House Intelligence Committee tomorrow.

> **UPDATE:**
>
> After his closed-door questioning, Kushner spoke to reporters outside the White House saying, “Let me be very clear: I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so. I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds for my businesses and I have been fully transparent in providing all requested information.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kushner-arrives-at-senate-for-closed-door-questioning-on-russia/2017/07/24/f5be2b26-7073-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/us/politics/jared-kushner-russia-senate.html))

2/ **Kushner's statement included details of a previously undisclosed meeting with the Russian ambassador** in April 2016. Kushner met Ambassador Sergei Kislyak at an event at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, DC in April 2016 – the same event where Jeff Sessions met with the ambassador, [but didn't remember](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/06/01/Day-133/#3-congress-is-examining-whether-jeff). He blamed the omission on his security clearance forms as a mistake made by his assistant.

3/ **Trump wants to know why "beleaguered" Jeff Sessions isn't investigating Clinton**. Last week, Trump said he never would have nominated Sessions if he knew he intended to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.

4/ **Trump floated the possibility of bringing in Rudolph Giuliani to head the Justice Department** after sandbagging Sessions in recent days. Giuliani was an early Trump supporter, raising questions about his independence, and making it hard to find 50 Republicans senators to confirm him.

5/ **Trump threatened Republicans that the "repercussions will be far greater" than they expect** if they don't repeal and replace Obamacare. Earlier, Trump went after members of his own party, saying Republicans "do very little to protect their President." The Senate is a planing a vote this week on the revised healthcare legislation.

6/ **Scaramucci: Trump is unconvinced that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 election**. The new communications director said Trump doesn't accept the intelligence community's conclusion that the Russian government attempted to hurt Hillary Clinton and help Trump. Trump tweeted: "As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!" ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/23/politics/anthony-scaramucci-donald-trump/index.html))

7/ **Kellyanne Conway says Russia is "not a big story" and that Trump “doesn’t think he’s lying” about voter fraud and wiretapping**. Conway claimed that the media doesn’t offer “complete coverage” of the Trump administration and that it's “incredibly unfair and systematically against this president.” Trump has claimed that millions have voted illegally and accused Obama of wiretapping him — despite having no proof of it happening. Conway said Trump "doesn’t think he’s lying about those issues."

8/ **Scaramucci outs Trump as his anonymous source** while disputing the conclusion that Russian meddled in the election. “Somebody said to me yesterday — I won’t tell you who — that if the Russians actually hacked this situation and spilled out those emails, you would have never seen it, you would have never had any evidence of them," Scaramucci said. After meeting with Putin in Germany, Trump said that "somebody did say" that if Putin did order the hacking, "you wouldn’t have found out about it." Trump didn't say who that "somebody" was but called the idea "a very interesting point." ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/343373-scaramucci-outs-trump-as-anonymous-source-on-russian-intel) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/23/world/europe/trump-putin-sanctions-hacking.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-interview-highlights-idUSKBN19X34X))

9/ **Scaramucci's strategy for curtailing leaks: Fire everybody**. "If you're going to keep leaking, I'm going to fire everybody." He called leaking information "un-American," "unprofessional and harmful." ([CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/scaramucci-on-white-house-leakers-theyre-going-to-get-fired/))

10/ **Scaramucci tells Sarah Huckabee Sanders to use the hair and makeup person from Friday’s briefing**. “I want to do everything I can to make her better at that podium... Like every athlete that's training for the Olympics, every day we got to make ourselves incrementally better,” Scaramucci said. “The only thing I ask Sarah, Sarah if you’re watching, I loved the hair and makeup person that we had on Friday. So I’d like to continue to use the hair and makeup person,” Scaramucci added.
